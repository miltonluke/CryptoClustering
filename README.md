# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Launch the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. Run the cells for output. Answers to the questions are answered in the jupyter notebook.
